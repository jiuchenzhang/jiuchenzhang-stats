I am a postdoctoral researcher in the Department of Biostatistics at [University of Michigan](https://sph.umich.edu/), working under the mentorship of Professor [Peter Song](https://sph.umich.edu/faculty-profiles/song-peter.html). I completed my Ph.D. in 2024 at the [University of California, Irvine](https://www.uci.edu/), in the [Department of Statistics](https://www.stat.uci.edu/), where I was advised by Professor [Annie Qu](https://faculty.sites.uci.edu/qulab/). Prior to that, I earned my Master’s degree in Statistics from the [University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign](https://illinois.edu/) in 2018 and my Bachelor’s degree from the [School of Mathematical Sciences](http://www.math.zju.edu.cn/mathen/) at [Zhejiang University](https://www.zju.edu.cn/english/) in 2016.

My research focuses on the development of machine learning models and continuous time reinforcement learning, with particular interest in their application to mobile health data, especially data from wearable devices.
