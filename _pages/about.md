I am a third-year Ph.D. student in the Department of Statistics at UC Irvine. I am currently working with Professor [Annie Qu](https://faculty.sites.uci.edu/qulab/). Prior to join UC Irvine, I got my Master’s degree in [Department of Statistics](https://stat.illinois.edu/) from [University of Illinois Urbana Champaign](https://illinois.edu/) in 2018. Before that, I obtained my Bachelor’s degree from [School of Mathematical Sciences](http://www.math.zju.edu.cn/mathen/) at [Zhejiang University](https://www.zju.edu.cn/english/) in 2016.

My current research interests are tensor factorization and latent factor modeling, and their application in recommender system and health data.
